   <h2>Biographical Note:</h2>
   <p>Caroline Agnes Boa was born on April 7, 1877, in Wisconsin. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1901 and taught high school English and Latin in Red Oak, Iowa until 1903. She then taught in Des Moines, Iowa until 1907. Henderson took up a "claim" to land in the Panhandle of Oklahoma, not far from the New Mexico border. She married Wilhelmine Eugene Henderson, a farmer, and had one daughter, Eleanor. Caroline and Eugene lived through the worst years of the Great Depression on their farm, which was located in the heart of the "Dust Bowl" region. They worked the land well into old age and did not leave Oklahoma until 1966, when they were both nearly 89 years of age and in failing health. They then moved to Phoenix, Arizona to be closer to Eleanor. </p>

   <h2>Introduction:</h2>
   <p>Caroline A. Henderson, Mount Holyoke College Class of 1901, farmed a land claim in the Oklahoma Panhandle from 1907 until 1966. She struggled against recurring droughts, dust storms, extreme blizzards, and other disasters. And yet, through all of these troubles, she and her husband chose to stay on their land.</p>

    <p>Henderson’s firsthand accounts of the Dust Bowl years are preserved in the Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections through the letters that she wrote to friends and family members, along with other writings that she published in Practical Farmer and the Atlantic Monthly.</p>

    <p>The Caroline A. Henderson Papers have been digitized by Mount Holyoke’s Digital Assets and Preservation Services Department and are available here for reading and research.</p>
